Created a 3D interactive installation demo for the lab’s product portfolio.

Demo was targeted to be proposed for CP’s Forestia residential project.

Worked on all the modelling, rigging, animation, materials, shaders, lighting and VFX. 

For the gameplay and motion capture programming, I collaborated with a skilled programmer in the 
innovation lab.
