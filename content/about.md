# Hello, <s>World</s> There!

I'm Austin, an undergrad in computer science at Mahidol University. My focus is in computer graphics and technical art. 

---
On this site, I discuss 🐇**graphics and shader programming, 🎨technical art**, and whatever else that interests me. You can scroll down for [featured notes](#featured-notes) or go to [notes](notes) for all notes.
