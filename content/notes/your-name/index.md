I bought a new laptop after wrapping up work for bangkok design week. My 5 year old laptop rocking GTX 1050 and 7th generation i5 could no longer keep up. I wanted to give my new laptop for a spin. I downloaded the latest version of Blender (version 4.1 at the time) and found some inspiration and got to work.

This specific cover art from Your Name has always instilled interesting feellings in me. I never can quite put my finger on exactly what but always found it moving. Funnily enough, I havn't watched the anime yet (which I definatley should) but I do occasionally listen to it's OST. I think I know why I am so entranced by the art, because I havn't watched it I have so many questions to what is happening? I don't know, lets get to the breakdown!

# Elements
All elements are relativley simple geometry, most geometry is just a vehicle for the shaders applied over them. I do not use any special plugins all vanilla blender here

## Trail

## Sky

## Clouds

## Compositing
I wanted to push the render a little more with some post-process effects and color grading that to enhance the composition. Also I add the official typography over the top to seal the deal.
