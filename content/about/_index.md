# About Me

<b>TL;DR</b>  
I aspire to develop real-time interactive tools and software for creatives and engineers in areas related to computer graphics.

---

I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science at Mahidol University. Although I'm pivoting away from a career focused on design and technical art, my passion remains in computer graphics. 

Currently, I'm particularly interested in <mark>visualization, simulation, tooling, and computer aided design applications for real-time and offline productions.</mark>

Other things that I like doing outside of computers and art is cooking, binging albums, horror games, a hike in nature and sipping on ice cold <span class="font-sans-thai font-normal tracking-tight">ชามะนาว</span>.

<!-- ---
Growing up in South Africa I always had these interests clash, I was drawn to the arts but I was also drawn to the maths and sciences. I was fascinated to know how things were made, I always watched the extras on all the DVDs I had at home and binged the hell out of How Its Made on the Discovery channel. I loved creation and how math and sciences were the means of doing that. However there was this notion growing up that these interests were to be separate. Attempting of having a deep interest in both were seen as counterproductive or unrealistic. Yet to me it always made sense that having a deep interest in both the arts and STEM could coexist and even intersect each other in interesting ways.

## FAQ
### What is your favorite show?
**Severance**. It's so weird, sci-fi and full of questions. It's also beautifully filmed, especially for a show set mostly in eerily clinical white rooms.

<span class="font-sans-thai">ขนมจีนแกงไตปลา</span>
